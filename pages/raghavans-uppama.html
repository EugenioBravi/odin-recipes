<h1>Raghavan's Uppama</h1>
<img src="../img/raghavans-uppama.jpeg">
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Â¼ cup ghee</li>
    <li>1 cup uncooked creamy wheat cereal, not instant (such as Cream of Wheat)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons ghee</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon black or yellow mustard seeds</li>
    <li>2 dried chile de arbol peppers, stemmed</li>
</ul>
<h3>Directions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Melt 1/4 cup ghee in a large skillet over medium heat. Pour in creamy wheat cereal; toast, stirring frequently, until light brown and nutty-smelling, 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a bowl. Wipe the skillet with a paper towel.</li>
    <li>Heat remaining 2 tablespoons ghee in the skillet over medium-high heat. Add mustard seeds; cover and wait until seeds stop popping (like popcorn), about 30 seconds. Add cashews and chiles; stir-fry until nuts are golden brown and chiles blacken, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Stir in carrot, peas, curry leaves, and turmeric; stir-fry about 2 minutes. Stir in 3 cups water and the salt and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer, covered, until carrots are fork-tender, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Reduce heat to medium-low and stir in toasted cream of wheat. (It will instantly absorb liquid and begin to swell.) Cover and cook until fully softened, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat; let stand, covered, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Stir in remaining 1/4 cup water if desired for a creamier texture. Sprinkle with cilantro and serve warm.</li>
</ol>
